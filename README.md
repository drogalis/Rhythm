## For Newcomers

Welcome to the world of alternative keyboard layouts!

The elevator pitch — by using english speech patterns and the dictionary of english words,
you can develop a keyboard layout that makes it easier to type common english words.

That's it — the goal is to make typing easier. QWERTY was invented in 1874 and since then many people have tried to do exactly that.

You may have heard of layouts like Dvorak or Colmak, which do provide a large improvement over QWERTY, but to quantify 
the levels of improvement — let's use some numbers and definitions.

Here are some common acronyms to describe keyboard layouts:

```
SFB       - lower is better
DSFB      - lower is better
LSB       - lower is better
Rolls     + higher is better
Redirects - lower is better
```

- If you want a detailed description of each see the section on [terminology](#Terminology).

Here's a brief table summary of the statistics for the most well known keyboard layouts:

```
                     Rhythm      QWERTY      Dvorak     Colmak DH    Workman
SFB:                 0.738%      6.615%      2.779%      1.387%      3.000%
DSFB:                6.006%     11.196%      6.979%      8.877%      8.248%
LSB:                 0.934%      6.882%      1.255%      1.975%      1.727%

Total Rolls:        51.003%     37.243%     38.924%     46.113%     46.113%
Total Redirects:     6.342%     13.187%      3.458%     10.579%     10.414%
```

As you can see Rhythm provides a substantial improvement over the other well known layouts. You may be 
surprised by the wide margin — no one else thought of these improvements? — they have, just see the Keyboards Alt Layout Source or the [Experts](#For-Experts) section below.

##### Getting Started

Now that you have been convinced that there's some benefit to switching keyboard layouts — let's look at the costs.
Switching layouts is not a small undertaking, it often takes months of work (see below experts section).  If 
you are someone who plans on doing a large amount of typing, it may be a good long term investment. I recommend 
checking out youtube videos for testimonials about other people's experience of switching layouts (good and bad).

Here's some creators with unbiased perspectives:

most modern keyboard layouts and a more detailed plan on how to get started. 

## For Experts

The goal of this project was to find a keyboard layout that had the best feel, flow, and <i>rhythm</i>.
I tried several of the top contenders, but ultimately settled on designing my own.

When deciding which layout to use, a combination of theoretical data and real world experimenting is required. Lets start with the theory as described in the following table.

Here's a brief table summary of the main statistics for the top alternative keyboard layouts:

```
                     Rhythm      Sturdy      Canary      Recurva     Gallium     Graphite
SFB:                 0.738%      0.935%      0.962%      0.829%      0.956%      0.996%
DSFB:                6.006%      6.222%      8.057%      5.756%      6.456%      6.260%
LSB:                 0.934%      2.413%      2.675%      1.844%      1.456%      1.358%

Total Rolls:        51.003%     48.082%     48.537%     48.176%     44.566%     44.276%
Total Redirects:     6.342%      5.399%      7.152%      5.549%      3.157%      3.043%

Right Hand:          50.58%      55.13%      56.09%      53.21%      51.50%      51.74%
Left Hand:           49.06%      44.52%      43.56%      46.44%      48.14%      48.07%
```

- For a very deep dive into the theory see the following: [Keyboard Theory Doc Source](https://bit.ly/layout-doc-v2)

Determining which layout to use depends on individual typing style. It's recommended to select 4 keyboard layouts and spend a week on each to find the best fit.
It typically takes a month of experimenting to find your preferences, and another two months of practice to become proficient at the layout of choice.

I recommend practicing with the following resources: 

- [Monkey Type](https://monkeytype.com/)
- [TypingClub](https://www.typingclub.com/)

Rhythm should be a layout to consider for one of the weeks of the month long experimentation process.

##### Main Strengths

The attributes that set Rhythm apart from other alternative keyboard layouts are the very low SFBs, minimal LSBs, extremely high rolls, and an even hand split.

On [cyanophage](https://cyanophage.github.io/) there's an option to sort layouts by SFB percentage — Rhythm is in the top 3 (top 2 when only considering standard 30 key layouts). 
The low SFBs allow for a fast typing speed by giving each finger time to 'set up' the next key press.

If you're looking for the lowest possible LSBs, there are other layouts specifically designed for that purpose, but Rhythm still scores in the top 40%!

High rolls is where Rhythm shines. To my knowledge (correct me if I'm wrong) there's no other viable keyboard layout with excess of 51.003% rolls — putting Rhythm in the number one spot! 
That being said, a major concern is the roll / redirect ratio. Other layouts focus on reducing redirects rather than increasing rolls.
I recommend trying out a low redirect layout to see if it better fits your typing style.

Lastly, the hand split on Rhythm is very close to 50 / 50 — reducing strain by balancing the work across both hands. 
As a note, the hand split numbers don't total to 100% — this is due to the small amount of typing work done outside of the main 30 keys. See the colemak mod statistics below for the complete picture. 


##### Potential Weaknesses

Although this is a very strong layout, there are some weaknesses. The left pinky finger has higher usage - 9.36%
as compared to the average alt layout which is ~8.0%. The left pinky also has a large SFB, the 'SY' bigram, which is very slow to type.
Overall, I find it still manageable - especially considering the other strengths of the layout.

Additionally, the number of HSB is 6.07% as compared to an average of ~2.0%. This is mainly due to the 'TH' half scissor,
but considering it's with two strong fingers — I don't find it to be a major concern.
After taking out the 'TH' scissor, the layout drops to ~2.5% HSB, which is on par with other alt layouts.

## Terminology

A non-exhaustive list of keyboard layout terminology:

- Bigram: A sequence of two keys (not containing space)
- Trigram: A sequence of three keys (not containing space)
- SFB: Same Finger Bigram; a bigram that requires the same finger for both keys
- DSFB: Disjointed Same Finger Bigram; pressing two keys with the same finger, separated by x letters
- LSB: Lateral Stretch Bigram; a bigram typed with adjacent fingers, but requires a lateral stretch
- Redirect: A trigram which changes direction on the same hand (excluding SFBs)
- HSB: Half Scissor Bigram; a bigram of adjacent columns, separated by one row
- FSB: Full Scissor Bigram; a bigram of adjacent columns, separated by two rows
- Roll: A trigram which changes hands once (excluding SFBs)
- Alternate: A trigram which changes hands twice (excluding SFBs)
